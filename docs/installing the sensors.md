# S0 sensor
Mounting the kWh meter in the meter cabinet must be done with care. If the meter is used for solar production, the in- and output must be swapped. Otherwise the meter would run in reverse, but this is blocked by the meter so it would stay at 0.

It is also possible to use an existing meter without S0 pulse but with a blinking LED and mount a phototransistor to the LED.
