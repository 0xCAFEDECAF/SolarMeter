<h1>Software configuration</h1>
<p><strong>PVoutput</strong></p>
<p>Before sending data to PVoutput.org, you have to setup an account on that site.<br>
When this is done, you can navigate to the settings tab.<br>
On this page there, under the header &quot;API settings&quot; is a long number called API-key.<br>
Edit the file userdefs.h and copy this number over the &quot;xxx&quot; behind the PVOUTPUT_KEY.<br>
<br>
Also on the settings page is the system-id (SID) of all of your defined systems.<br>
Change the line SID1=0 in userdefs.h so that it matches the SID of your system.<br>
If you have multiple S0 meters, you have to change SID2 and SID3 also.<br>
Leave SID2 and SID3 at 0 if you only have one sensor.</p>
<p><strong>V8</strong></p>
<p>If you are using version 8 of the software, there are some new features that can be configured via the userdefs.h file:</p>
<p>If the variable USE_LOGGING is defined, the SD card software will be used.<br>
If you do not want to use the SD card, comment this line and you will have extra room for other features.</p>
<p>Each sensor now has 3 parameters:</p>
<p>SID = the system ID that corresponds to the SID on you PVoutput page.</p>
<p>SID_PIN = the digital input pin that the sensor is connected to.</p>
<p>SID_PLS = the number of pulses that the sensor gives when it counts 1kWh.</p>
<p>If you enter a negative number for SID_PLS, the software will send this sensor to the production counter of PVoutput.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For example, the next configuration will use one sensor for production (solar) and one sensor for power consumption, on the same SID:</p>
<p>#define SID1 1234<br>
#define SID1_PIN 2<br>
#define SID1_PLS 1000</p>
<p>#define SID2 1234<br>
#define SID1_PIN 3<br>
#define SID1_PLS -1000</p>
<p>//#define SID3 1234<br>
//#define SID3_PIN 4<br>
//#define SID3_PLS 1000</p>
<p><strong>V8.1 - Mail configuration</strong></p>
<p>To send a mail once a day, the line #define USE_MAIL must be un-commented.</p>
<p>You have to setup the name of the mail server of your internet provider so that mails can be sent without password.</p>
<p>Finally you can change the hour when the mail should be sent.</p>
